# Contact-Management-using-Binary-Search-Tree
To develop a Contact Management System using a Binary Search Tree
(BST) to efficiently store and manage contact information. The system
should provide functionality for adding, searching, updating, and
deleting contacts. Contacts are represented by their names and
associated details, such as phone numbers, email addresses, and other
relevant information. The goal is to create an efficient and organized
system for managing contacts.
Example:
Imagine you have a contact management system implemented using a
Binary Search Tree (BST). You want to find a specific contact, &quot;Alice,&quot;
in your contact list. Here&#39;s how the system performs the search
operation:
1. Start at the root of the BST.
2. Compare &quot;Alice&quot; with the name of the contact stored at the current
node.
3. Since &quot;Alice&quot; is lexicographically smaller than the current contact&#39;s
name, move to the left child node.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you find &quot;Alice&quot; or reach a leaf node.
5. In this case, you find &quot;Alice&quot; as a contact in the tree.

This example demonstrates how a BST efficiently narrows down the
search space, allowing you to find the desired contact, &quot;Alice,&quot; quickly
by exploiting the hierarchical structure and alphabetical ordering of the
data.
